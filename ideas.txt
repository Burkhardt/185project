individuals could be:
bacteria
viruses
small animals like squids

parameters could be:
optimum pH, pH range that is survivable
optimum temperature, temperature that is survivable
life span
repdoductive rate
color, for camouflage

some parameters should be user controlled; such as environment pH, temp, background color
some parameters can be inherited or randomly mutated, but they cannot exceed a certain total score: life span and reproductive rate can't both be high. optimum pH range and temp range can't both be large.

how to harness user data in a useful way?
start by collecting user data and analysing statistically. insights may or may not result.

e.g. what are the best organism that develop? is there a trend?
